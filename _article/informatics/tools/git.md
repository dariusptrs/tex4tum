Git is an open-source version control system.
It is used to manage a set of files, as they change over time. 


## Terms

* **Working Directory:** simply the files in the root folder
* **Commit:** A certain version of the files
* **Tag**: a named pointer to a certain commit.
* **Branch:** A chain of commits 
* **Master:** Default Branch
* **Head:** a named pointer to the current branch

Repository: 
It is stored in the same directory as the project itself, in a subdirectory called `.git`.



## Usage
1. clone a git repository: `git clone git://...` or create one `git init`
1. Commit 



### Commit Object
A Commit Object is a set files. 
It can be referred by its partial or full SHA1 name or relative to a head. The postfix `^` refers to the parent of a head.


Head: simply a named reference to a commit object. By default, there is a head in every repository called *master*.


### Branch:

### Index
The index (= Stage = Cache) 

### Tag
Tags are pointers to a certain commit. They use a name which is more memorizeable than the hash of the commit.






## Commands

| Command    | Description |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `git init` | creates a new repository in the current directory |




| Changes | |
|---|---|
| `git status` | lists modified and untracked files |
| `git diff HEAD` | shows changes between working dir and HEAD |

### Undo local changes
To undo local changes use `git checkout -- <FILE>`. If `<FILE>` is already staged (happens if you do `git add`), you can use `git reset HEAD <FILE>` and then `git checkout -- <FILE>`


### Undo local commits
If you already commited changes but you want to reset them to version of the `origin`, you can use `git reset --hard origin/master`


### Merge master into feature branch
```
git fetch origin master:master
git rebase master
git push -f
```



### Link code lines in issues
* view file, click on start line number 
* hold shift, click on end line
* press `y` to create permanent URL (hash)
